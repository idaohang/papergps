07jul17 - dcb - @Boolardy setting up. Changed PC clock to run
 on London time. This changes UTC/LST in <statgps>. Not sure
 why as I would think that UTC comes from gps and is not dependent
 on PC clock....in fact sets PC clock. Ah..but setting PC, under
 root, to London time gives BTC, not UTC. They differ by an hour.

 Further..PC time in top bar is 10:13 AM BST; UTC in UTC/LST of
 <statgps> reads 9:13, but Thunderbolt GPS Date/Time reads
 8:14! This is, I think, because Ismael has +1h in his code.
